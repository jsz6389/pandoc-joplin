I found a useful Joplin plugin that allows you to render charts from a table. There is a test of it below.
https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/plugin-turn-to-chart/21584
https://github.com/Winbee/joplin-turn-to-chart
```turnToChart
|x|a|b|c|
|-|-|-|-|
|n|0|2|3|
|m|2|1|3|
|o|3|2|1|
```
By default, Joplin can use [Mermaid](#https://mermaid.js.org/#/) syntax to create flowcharts, however this seems overly complex and is probably not a feature that I will make heavy use of.

The [Better Code Blocks](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/plugin-better-code-blocks/32613) Joplin plugin isn't really one that is useful to me. All it does is hide the "\`\`\`" in the markdown editor, which is kind of annoying.

If I want to apply code syntax to something, I can just do \`\`\`[language]. For example, an sql codeblock would be \`\`\`sql.

Currently my personal time is split between the following things:
- Technical Projects
- Studying Japanese
- Researching for the trip to Japan
- Gaming

I have already managed to integrate Japanese study nicely into my daily routine. I find it challenging, however, to manage my time between the other three passions. Therefore, I would like to begin creating a daily schedule for the three, dedicating at least one day a week to them. This will leave will leave four days a week open to do as I please, and gives me the opportunity to pick up other hobbies if I so choose. 

For gaming, I would also like to start streaming once I move into my new apartment. I already have a sufficient streaming setup, so this should be quite easy to accomplish. I would like to acquire a new graphics card, as that will make it easier to play more intensive games, though that will probably have to wait until I have my GS-9 in August.

Earlier this month, I implemented a calendar-based system as detailed above, so I will integrate my three passions into this system starting in June. I will game on Mondays, since gaming requires the least thought and effort, I will research for Japan on Wednesdays, and I will work on technical projects on Fridays.

I am having trouble focusing on my goals again. This past weekend I've basically just sat around watching YouTube. When I don't have any time to myself its very easy to slip into a routine of watching an endless stream of mindless content on YouTube and Instagram. I have been watching many videos in Japanese, which is something I would like to continue doing. That being said, even just sitting and playing some game would be more enjoyable to me. On top of that I would like to spend more time studying Japanese. The problem is I haven't been able to settle on much of a routine ever since I completed Heisig. Since things have been so hectic, maybe I'll just settle for the immersion route and try to watch more videos in Japanese without subtitles. With me going to Germany in September, I can't really see myself developing a study routine that's more regimented than that. It's hard to believe, but pretty soon I'll be going to Japan again.
